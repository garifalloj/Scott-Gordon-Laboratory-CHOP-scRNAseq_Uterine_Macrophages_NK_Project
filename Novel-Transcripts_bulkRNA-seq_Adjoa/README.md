Project Description:

Examine the role of macrophages and NK cells after stim and no stim for DE genes and DE transcripts. Examine the role of novel transcripts within the CD122mutants

bulkRNAseq libraries performed with TruSeq total RNAseq with ribo depletion. 150bp x 150bp read length

GRCm38/mm10 reference for previous qPCR experiments.

Bioinformatics Updates:
libraries aligned with STAR 2.7.10 (ensembl GRCm38 with 150bp read length index) and salmon gencode for pseudo alignment/quantification.

gene counting in Rsubread with featureCounts algorithm.

Downstream DE in DEseq2. 


Novel transcript assembly:

Transcripts assembled by stringtie (JHU)
